# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature provides a web-based to-do list application that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. Users can add, edit, complete, and delete tasks, with the ability to organize and track their progress through an intuitive interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to add new tasks to my to-do list, so that I can keep track of things I need to accomplish.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enters a task description and clicks "Add" THEN the system SHALL create a new task and display it in the list
2. WHEN the user tries to add an empty task THEN the system SHALL prevent the addition and display an error message
3. WHEN a new task is added THEN the system SHALL automatically assign it an "incomplete" status

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to mark tasks as complete, so that I can track my progress and see what I've accomplished.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks on a task's checkbox THEN the system SHALL mark the task as complete
2. WHEN a task is marked complete THEN the system SHALL visually distinguish it from incomplete tasks (e.g., strikethrough text)
3. WHEN the user clicks on a completed task's checkbox THEN the system SHALL mark it as incomplete again

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to delete tasks from my list, so that I can remove items that are no longer relevant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks a delete button for a task THEN the system SHALL remove the task from the list
2. WHEN a task is deleted THEN the system SHALL update the display immediately without requiring a page refresh
3. WHEN the user attempts to delete a task THEN the system SHALL provide a clear delete action (button or icon)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to edit existing tasks, so that I can update task descriptions when they change.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user double-clicks on a task description THEN the system SHALL allow inline editing of the text
2. WHEN the user finishes editing and presses Enter or clicks away THEN the system SHALL save the changes
3. WHEN the user presses Escape while editing THEN the system SHALL cancel the edit and revert to the original text

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see all my tasks in an organized list, so that I can easily review what needs to be done.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL display all existing tasks in a clear, readable format
2. WHEN there are no tasks THEN the system SHALL display a helpful message indicating the list is empty
3. WHEN tasks are present THEN the system SHALL show incomplete tasks prominently and completed tasks in a visually distinct way

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want my tasks to persist between browser sessions, so that I don't lose my to-do list when I close and reopen the browser.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user adds, edits, completes, or deletes a task THEN the system SHALL save the changes to local storage
2. WHEN the user refreshes the page or reopens the browser THEN the system SHALL restore all previously saved tasks
3. WHEN local storage is not available THEN the system SHALL still function but inform the user that tasks won't persist
